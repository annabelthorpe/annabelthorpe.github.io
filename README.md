# ü§∏‚Äç ‚Äì A Blog Theme for Jekyll
Cartwheel is a blog theme for Jekyll built using HTML, Sass, and jQuery. External stylesheets and libraries included are Google Fonts, Font Awesome, Normalize.CSS, Instafetch.js, Owl Carousel 2, Smooth Scroll, and WOW.js.

## Installation
All dependencies are saved in the ````Gemfile````. Run ````bundle install```` (Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) if it is not already).

## Edit Theme
I made everything as easy as possible to edit. Most things can be found in the ````_config.yml````, but if more editing is required digging through the code will be required. The ````head.html```` file is in the ````_includes```` folder and the Sass variables are found in the ````_base.scss```` file in the ````_sass```` folder.

### _config.yml

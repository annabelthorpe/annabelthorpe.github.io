<h3>CNN</h3>
June 2019  - August 2019

At CNN, I interned for Erin Burnett OutFront. I worked daily on the evening newscast. I also completed a research project for the team over the 2020 election. I then completed several packages. For PKG below, I pitched the idea, set up and conducted my own interviews, and wrote and tracked the script. I also shot and edited the piece with oversight from CNN’s photographers and editors.

<h3>London Live</h3>
January 2020-March 2020
<div>
</div>
During my semester abroad, I interned for London Live. London Live is a local news station with an hour long evening newscast every weekday. Each shift, I turned a new story for them. I shot, edited, and tracked each story. London Live uses a lot of pieces without reporter track—it focuses on a more short documentary style.

I was the youngest intern to work for the Dallas Morning News, and I interned for the organization two summers in a row. My first summer, I worked as a metro news reporter, covering a variety of topics from a theatre troupe to a vandalism with a drugged up vandal. I also made DMN's first intern recruitment video.

I was invited back my junior year as the first video intern in a position they created for me. I covered ceremonies and events in response to the Dallas Ambush. Some videos I made were for social media posts, while others were paired with online stories or purely for YouTube.

As a producer at KOMU-TV, I've learned invaluable lessons about time management, writing quickly and for the ear and, most importantly, working under pressure. I have experience producing the noon show, the five p.m., the 6 p.m., the 9 p.m., and the morning show (11 p.m. to 8 a.m. shift.) For the Fall 2018 semester, I produced the 9 p.m. show every Tuesday night.

I know who to:
* write good copy
* write attention-catching teases, headlines and promos
* create a logical, flowing newscast
* pick the most newsworthy lead
* work with reporters throughout the day
* manage breaking news
* use iNews
* booth shows and cue live reporters
* use effective supers
* utilize BAMS, OTS, ROLLING BAMS, PRE-SQUEEZE, BOXES, other graphics

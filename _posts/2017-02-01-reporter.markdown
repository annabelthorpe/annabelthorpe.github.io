I am a multimedia journalists for KOMU-TV, so I interview, shoot and edit all my own stories. I've learned how to turn stories quickly and push for the interviews needed to tell the best story. All of the stories below, except the featured pkg, are day turns.

I know how to:
* pitch newsworthy stories
* shoot all my own video
* interview
* live tweet my stories
* edit on Premiere Pro, Final Cut and Avid
* turn PKGS and VOSOTVOs
* work in iNews
* go live with a Dejero backpack
* complete demonstrative stand-ups (my favorite!)

I am a multimedia journalists for KOMU-TV, so I interview, shoot and edit all my own stories. I have worked Saturday and Sunday morning shifts, completing 6 live hits by the end of the morning. I've learned how to turn stories quickly and push for the interviews needed to tell the story best. Storytelling is my passion, and I am known for getting stories that accentuate interesting people and events in Columbia, MO.

I know how to:
* pitch newsworthy stories
* shoot all my own video
* interview
* live tweet my stories
* edit on Premiere Pro, Final Cut and Avid
* voice my PKGS
* turn PKGS and VOSOTVOs
* work in iNews
* go live with a Dejero backpack
* design creative stand-ups
* complete demonstrative stand-ups (my favorite!)

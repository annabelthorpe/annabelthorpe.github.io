I am a multimedia journalists for KOMU-TV; I interview, write, shoot and edit all my stories. I've learned how to turn stories quickly and push for the interviews needed to tell the best story.

I know how to:
* complete demonstrative stand-ups
* pitch newsworthy stories
* shoot all my own video
* interview
* live tweet my stories
* edit on Premiere Pro, Final Cut and Avid
* turn PKGS and VOSOTVOs
* work in iNews
* go live with a Dejero backpack

Youngest and first. I was the youngest intern at the Dallas Morning News as a sophomore in high school. That first summer, I worked as a metro news reporter, covering a variety of topics from a theatre troupe to a massive vandalism with a drugged up assailant. I also made DMN's intern recruitment video.

I was invited back my junior year as the first video intern in a position they created for me. I went to many assignments that pushed me out of my comfort zone, especially during the Dallas Ambush. Some video I made were for social media posts, while others were for stories, while others were for purely for web.

I spent time at DMN during its transition to a web-first publication. A BIG change for Texas' top newspaper. I was able to be part of that change; publisher and CEO Jim Moroney asked the interns for advice to target younger crowds. He also wrote a recommendation letter for me. I feel I will always have a home at the Dallas Morning News.

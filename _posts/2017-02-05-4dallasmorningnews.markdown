<h3>Dallas Morning News</h3>

I was the youngest intern to work for the Dallas Morning News, and I interned for the organization two summers in a row. My first summer, I worked as a metro news reporter, covering a variety of topics from a theatre troupe to a vandalism with a drugged up vandal. I also made DMN's first intern recruitment video.

I was invited back my junior year as the first video intern in a position they created for me. I covered ceremonies and events in response to the Dallas Ambush. Some videos I made were for social media posts, while others were paired with online stories or purely for YouTube.

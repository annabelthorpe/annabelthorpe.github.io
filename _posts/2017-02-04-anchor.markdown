I anchor full newscasts, and I've done everything from morning to noon to evening newscasts. Currently, solo anchor the Sunday morning newscast each week. I co-produce the hour-long newscast.

I know how to:
* write scripts and teases
* use multiple prompters
* impromptu chats with the other anchors
* connect with stories
* handle technical errors on air (like prompter issues, reporter live shot drops, etc.)
* be comfortable and enunciate on camera

I started anchoring for KOMU-TV as a local cut-ins anchor during local looks on the TODAY show. Each hit was about 2 minutes long, and I did five hits per morning. Now, I anchor a full 30 minute show on Thursday mornings from 4:30 a.m. to 5 a.m. I've also covered the noon show and a few evenings shows. I've become a morning and night person!

I know how to:
* write scripts and teases
* use multiple prompters
* impromptu chats with the other anchors
* connect with stories
* handle technical errors on air (like prompter issues, reporter live shot drops, etc.)
* be comfortable and enunciate on camera

 I am a self-taught documentary film director, and I've made five short films. Each has placed in the top three at Texas’ state film festival. One year, I swept 1st, 2nd and 3rd with the three films I submitted, which has never happened before.

## Examples
#### More Than Music
<div>
Abbey Cone, a 20-year-old Texas woman, is chasing her dream of becoming the next big country singer/songwriter. Cone began her journey at age of 6, performing at the Grapevine Opry several times since. Later, she began traveling to Nashville and meeting industry professionals. She's had the fortune to sing with country star Josh Abbott multiple times, and by age 16, she signed a publishing deal with SNG Music. Cone always hopes that her music is more than just lyrics—that it's something that will make a difference.

<h4>The Hardest Mile</h4>
Kelsey Landrum, an amateur runner, refuses to be limited. In middle school, Landrum sporadically lost all feeling and control in her right leg. After visiting over 200 specialists, no doctor could name a cause. Many told her she would never run again. But Landrum kept going. She spent years in physical therapy, retraining the nerves in her leg. She applied to race in Asics Beat the Sun, a famous world race. Out of 56,000 applicants, Landrum was chosen as one of three amateur runners on Team Americas 2 in the race of a lifetime. No matter what, Landrum will always keep pushing through her hardest mile, never giving up in the pursuit of her dreams.

<h4>Pointe of the Spotlight</h4>
Three talented dancers from different stages of life experience both the difficulties and beautiful moments of dance. However, it is not what the common eye sees. By existing in the dance world, they have dealt with rigorous competition, bullying and defeat, as well as complete self-expression and the addicting sensation of the spotlight.

<h4>Rubber Band Reminders</h4>
Robert B. Hirschhorn runs the Cathy E. Bennett & Associates, Inc., in Lewisville, Texas and is a nationally recognized expert in jury and trial consultation. His inspiration to work hard comes from his humble beginnings, and he now travels the country as a nationally ranked high-profile jury consultant. Hirschhorn never forgets where he came from and his message reiterates the concept of giving back to those that can’t always help themselves.

<h4>Dallas Morning News Internship</h4>
Five high school summer interns of the 2015 class share their experiences about the Dallas Morning News internship program. They explain why future juniors and seniors should apply and what lessons they have taken away. It was definitely a summer to never forget.
